# armadillo

Design and control of a wheel capable of varying its radius over a range of values using a novel transformation mechanism. The transformation occurs without any additional actuators. Interestingly the wheel can vary its radius ranging from a large diameter to small diameter which enhances its maneuverability like small turning radius and fast/efficient locomotion.

The design methodology is explained with much detail in "design.pdf".

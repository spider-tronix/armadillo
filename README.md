# armadillo
Design and control of a wheel capable of varying its radius over a range of values using a novel transformation mechanism. The transformation occurs without any additional actuators. Interestingly the wheel can vary its radius ranging from a large diameter to small diameter which enhances its maneuverability like small turning radius and fast/efficient locomotion

%Oscillatory Mechanism:

%The angle of oscillation wrt to inner gear and outer gear is same.
phi*(2d/D-d)=(pi-phi)*(2D/D-d)
phi=pi/(1+(D/d))

%Ideal Angle of Oscillation

Theta=(2d/D-d)*phi
Theta=(2d/D-d)*pi/(1+(D/d))
Theta= 2*pi/(1-k^2)



%Angle of Oscillation with Clearance 

phi=phi-2*(2*pi/n)
Thetanew= (2/(1-k))*theta
Thetanew=  (2*pi/n)*(n-4(1+k))/(1-k^2)

%The angle of oscillation is fed to the gear train and Theta max is
%obtained
